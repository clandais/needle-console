# Demystify for Unity
## High performance understanding for stack traces

This package brings [Ben.Demystifier](https://github.com/benaadams/Ben.Demystifier) to Unity

> .NET stack traces output the compiler transformed methods; rather than the source code methods, which make them slow to mentally parse and match back to the source code.
> The current output was good for C# 1.0; but has become progressively worse since C# 2.0 (iterators, generics) as new features are added to the .NET languages and at C# 7.1 the stack traces are esoteric (see: Problems with current stack traces).
